Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing order.
Note: The binary array contains only 0  and 1.
 
Example 1:

Input: 
5
1 0 1 1 0

Output: 
0 0 1 1 1

Explanation: 
After arranging the elements in 
increasing order, elements will be as 
0 0 1 1 1.

Example 2:

Input:
10
1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0

Output: 
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1

Explanation: 
After arranging the elements in 
increasing order, elements will be 
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1.

Your Task: This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function binSort() that takes the array A[] and it's size N as parameters and sorts the array. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= A[i] <= 1
