Given an array of N positive integers where all numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find the exceptional number.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3}
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {5, 7, 2, 7, 5, 2, 5}
Output: 5

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getOddOccurrence() which takes arr[] and n as input parameters and returns the exceptional number.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
