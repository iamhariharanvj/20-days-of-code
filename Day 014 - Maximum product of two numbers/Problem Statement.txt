Given an array Arr of size N with all elements greater than or equal to zero. Return the maximum product of two numbers possible.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 6
Arr[] = {1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 0}  
Output: 42

Example 2:

Input: 
N = 5
Arr = {1, 100, 42, 4, 23}
Output: 4200

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxProduct() which takes the array of integers arr[] and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^4
